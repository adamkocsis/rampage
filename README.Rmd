Calibrated Color Ramps

This package was written out of sheer anger. Lots of visulization tasks involve plotting heatmaps, where colors represent numeric values. There is a high number of extensions that have pre-defined components to make such representations with color palettes, but having precise control over the exact relationship between colors and values seems to be a constant technical nuissance. The `rampage` extension aims to make this control easier and allow users to construct and use color ramps based on explicit relationships between colors and values.  

See the webpage of the package for more info and tutorials: https://adamtkocsis.com/rampage/
