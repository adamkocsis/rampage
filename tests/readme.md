# Unit testing suite of `rampage`

The current version of the testing suite uses md5sum-based graphical checks. This requires that the reference images need to be replicated on the testing machine with the older version of the package first, before development can continue.

The testing of the plotting functions will be migrated to `tinysnapshots`.
